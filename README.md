## Introduction

The raw data that motivated this work has been provided by Stratagem Technologies Ltd and consists of all touch-ball events for the 2013/14 season of the 
English Premier League. The data cannot be disclosed as the authors do not have the license to do so. Instead, in this GitHub repository we provide all the 
computer code, including the \textsf{Stan} templates, we used to carry out the analyses presented in this paper. We also provide guidance on how the code can be 
used to apply our methods to similar data sets, like the publicly-available 2020/21 FA Women's Super League Data provided by StatsBomb Inc. at
