## Introduction

This GitHub repository provides all the computer code used to carry out the analyses presented 
in our paper "Flexible marked spatio-temporal point processes with applications to event sequences 
from association football". The arXiv link to the paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04647).

The raw data that motivated our work has been provided by Stratagem Technologies Ltd and consists 
of all touch-ball events for the 2013/14 season of the English Premier League. The raw data cannot 
be disclosed as the authors do not have the license to do so. We provide guidance on how the code 
can be used to apply our methods to similar data sets, like the publicly-available 2020/21 FA Women's 
Super League Data provided by StatsBomb Inc. available [here](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).
